golang API to perform the CRUD operations

- C : create
- R : read
- U : update
- D : delete

<b> What these APIs do? </b>
- The APIs perform CRUD operations on the string
- To keep it lightweight project, the APIs don't connect to database 

<b> How to use this project? </b>
- install go binary and configure GOROOT env variable as per the location of GO binary
- create a directory structure dir_path/src. Where dir_path should be set as GOPATH env variable
- clone this code under src repo
- run go run main.go and the application will start on port 8000

<b> List of APIs </b>
- http://localhost:8000/resource/create - Create a new string and string the set value
- http://localhost:8000/resource/read - read the string value
- http://localhost:8000/resource/update - update a part of string with new value supplied
- http://localhost:8000/resource/delete - delete a part of string
- http://localhost:8000/resource/reset - reset the string. This will always display **Hello Terraform**.

<b> How to use automated testing </b>
- The go testing package supports automated testing.
- In order to run test testcases , please run go test -v ./... 
- This will trigger test cases in all the packages ( root and sub packages ).
- To see the test coverage, please use flags like -cover and -coverprofile while running to test command.
- Commands are go test -v -cover ./... or go test -v -coverprofile=cover.txt ./...
- Once you have cover.txt file, you can use a built in tool called cover to create an html report from this txt file.
- Command is - go tool cover -html=cover.txt -o cover.html.
- Open cover.html in browser to review the test coverage.

**Dockerfile**
- Application is using go module.
- It's important to copy go.mod and go.sum along with main.go in image for go to download dependencies at run time.
- This file completely defines the structure of your application.

**docker-compose.yml**
- This is declarative way of writing docker image.
- We can create multi container applications using docker-compose.
- ```docker-compose up``` will start the container application.
- ```docker-compose down``` will stop all the container application.
- ```docker-compose build``` will build all the images from docker file.
- ```docker-compose logs``` will show logs for all the running services.
